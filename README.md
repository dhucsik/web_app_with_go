In this repo I'm learning how to use go programming language in backend.

To start application:
1)delete go.mod and go.sum files
2)In terminal: go mod init github.com/dhucsik/web_app_with_go (you can write what you want but then you need to change imports in go files)
3)In terminal: go get github.com/alexedwards/scs/v2
go get github.com/go-chi/chi/v5
github.com/justinas/nosurf
4)go run ./cmd/web OR  go run cmd/web/.go


Go modules i used: 
github.com/go-chi/chi/v5
github.com/alexedwards/scs/v2
github.com/justinas/nosurf
